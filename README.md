Description:

Project Jupiter is a log-in verification program that aims to increase security wherever need. It is originally designed as a second log in screen for Windows PCs. The concept is once a user logs in through the standard Windows log-in, this program will boot and force the user to log-in. Command prompt and Task Manager are specifically killed if tried to open so there is no backdoor to this program. If the user inputs the password incorrectly three times, the computer freezes, until it detects an encrypted code on a designated USB.
